# Tower Defense
This is a group project made as part of a C++ course at Aalto University. It is a simple tower defense game created with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) featuring several different enemies, towers and maps as well as a map editor for easy creation of own maps.


Here are a couple of the enemies:

And and a few towers:
